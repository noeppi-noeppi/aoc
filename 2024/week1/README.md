This is a [Polyglot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_(computing)) file solving multiple days. Depending on the programming language used, it will solve a different day. If nothing else is stated below, input is read from the standard input.

* [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1): [Netwide Assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netwide_Assembler) for 64bit linux, assembled with the `--no-line` option.
* [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2): Plain [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX). Expects input in a file named `aocinput.txt`.
* [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3): [Racket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language))
* [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4): [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language))
* [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/5): [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language))
* [Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/6): [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl)
* [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/7): [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
* [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/8): [Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language))

The program can be found [here](solution).
